            <p id="abme">Hi there! I am Noel, a Frontend developer from Kerala.Currently I am studying in class 11 in computer science stream. I started web development at the age of 16. <br> Within the 1 year of time, I completed many small projects of my own. I am always ready to learn new technologies, languages and techniques. I completed HTML5, CSS3 and basic concepts JavaScript. Now I am learning jQuery and Bootstrap. <br> The tech stack I am focusing now is MERN stack because, I found that stack more interesting and in demand. I've earned a LinkedIn skill badge for CSS and now I am learning HTML in order to achieve the next badge. <br> I believe that networking with other developers is an important factor and I always try to make my LinkedIn profile active. <br> Networking with others have helped me a lot in order to learn new things. As a computer science student, I got a chance to build a solid understanding of programming concepts.</p>
